the Crypto library is installed with the command:

pip3 install pycryptodome

If it does NOT work

uninstall via pip3 uninstall pycryptodome

THEN 

navigate into the folder where all python scripts are and use the command:

pip3 install pycryptodome -t .

(that installs the package within the folder)


Run:
sudo python3 Starter.py 3 5
